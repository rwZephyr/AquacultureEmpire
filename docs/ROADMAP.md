This file tracks *version-level* priorities.  
See `feature-backlog.md` for the full list of ideas and long-term plans.

## v0.2 — Core Loop Polish & Stability
Goal: Ship a stable, optimized version of the core fish → harvest → sell loop with clear onboarding.

- Vessel hold save/load + shared ETA helper.
- Sanitize NaN issues in pens/dev tools.
- Add soft-gated onboarding (buttons disabled until prerequisites done).
- First-run tooltips & milestone checklist.
- Hold selector polish (UI hide/show & free capacity labels).
- Minimal top-bar tooltip labels + font pass.
- Inline vessel status with ETA everywhere.
- Browser-playtest checklist before merge.

## v0.3 — Onboarding & Early-Game Depth
Goal: Add meaningful choices early on and introduce light regional mechanics.

- Starter species choice modal (ties into warm/cold water).
- Region tags on sites; starter choice sets initial region.
- Simple market volatility/drift + occasional events.
- Multi-hold vessel availability; per-hold species enforcement.
- Mortality system scaffold (off by default, dev toggle).
- Tutorial overlay + help button.

## v0.4 — Economy, Staffing & Regional Expansion
Goal: Expand mid/late-game depth and operational complexity.

- Licenses to unlock new regions/species.
- Seasonal market patterns per region.
- Vessel upgrades (speed, capacity, crew, add-hold modules).
- Sell vessels & paid rename.
- Operating costs (fuel, maintenance, wages).
- Early staffing (basic perks & roles).
