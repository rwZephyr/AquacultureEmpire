# Project Overview
Aquaculture Empire is a simple browser game for managing fish farming operations.
The project runs entirely in the browser with no build step or server logic.

# Coding Style
- Use 2-space indentation for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Write JavaScript as ES6 modules and load them directly in the browser.
- Avoid transpilers or bundlers; keep code runnable as-is.

# Testing Locally
Run a static file server from the repository root and open `index.html` in your browser. For example:
```
python3 -m http.server
```
Any other static server is fine.

# Documentation
Whenever gameplay mechanics or the UI change, update `README.md` to keep instructions and features accurate.
